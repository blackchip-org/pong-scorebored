Building from source
--------------------

Development is done using NetBeans 7 and can be opened directly as a
project.

To run from the command line, type in:

```
ant jar
java -jar dist/pong-scorebored.jar
```

A Mac OS X application is also created in the dist directory.

There Be Dragons
----------------

Work was done on this application at warp 9. Therefore the code is ugly,
untestable, and difficult to naviagate through. You have been warned.
