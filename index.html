                <h3>Rules</h3>
                <p>
                The Pong Scorebored implements the following rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>Games can be either 11 or 21 points in length.</li>
                    <li>Matches can be a single game, best two out of three,
                        best three out of five, or best four out of seven.</li>
                    <li>Rally scoring is in effect.</li>
                    <li>There is a volley for service in the first game of a
                        match.</li>
                    <li>In subsequent match games, the loser of the previous
                        game serves first.</li>
                    <li>In 21 point games, servers change after every 5 points.</li>
                    <li>In 11 point games, servers change after every 2 points.</li>
                    <li>A win must be by at least 2 points.</li>
                    <li>In overtime servers change after every point.</li>
                    <li>In 21 point games:
                        <ul>
                        <li>Winning all 5 points in a service is an Ofer</li>
                        <li>Two consecutive Ofers is a Kenfer</li>
                        <li>Three consecutive Ofers is a Turkey</li>
                        <li>Four consecutive Ofers is a Double Kenfer</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>In 12 point games an Ofer is awarded for winning both
                        points in two consecutive services</li>
                    <li>In a 21 point game, Jacob is not impressed if you lose 
                        with 12 points or less.</li>
                </ul>
